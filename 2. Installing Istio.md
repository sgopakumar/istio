# Installing Istio
In the previous lab we saw how Envoy works. We also saw that Envoy needs a control plane to configure it in a dynamic environment like a cloud platform built on containers or Kubernetes.

Istio provides that control plane to drive the behavior of the network. Istio provides mechanisms for getting the Envoy proxy (also known as Istio service proxy, sidecar proxy, or data plane) integrated with workloads deployed to a system and for them to automatically connect to the control plane securely. Users can then use the control plane's API to drive the behavior of the network. Let's start installing and configuring Istio in this lab.

## Prerequisites
This lab will start by deploying some services in Kubernetes. The scenario we are replicating is one where Istio is being added to a set of workloads and that existing services are deployed into the cluster. In this lab (Lab 02) we will focus on getting Istio installed and in a later lab show how to iteratively roll out the mesh functionality to the workloads.

## Deploy the sample application
Let's set up the sample-apps:
```
kubectl create ns istioinaction
```
Now let's create some services:
```
kubectl apply -n istioinaction -f sample-apps/web-api.yaml
kubectl apply -n istioinaction -f sample-apps/recommendation.yaml
kubectl apply -n istioinaction -f sample-apps/purchase-history-v1.yaml
kubectl apply -n istioinaction -f sample-apps/sleep.yaml
```

After running these commands, we should check the pods running in the istioinaction namespace:
```
kubectl get po -n istioinaction
```
```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
purchase-history-v1-6c8cb7f8f8-wn4dr   1/1     Running   0          22s
recommendation-c9f7cc86f-nfvmk         1/1     Running   0          22s
sleep-8f795f47d-5jfbn                  1/1     Running   0          14s
web-api-6d544cff77-drrbm               1/1     Running   0          22s
```
You now have some existing workloads in your cluster. Let's proceed to install the Istio control plane.
## Istio CLI installation
- Download Istio
```
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.11.5 sh -
```
- Add the istioctl client to the PATH:
```
export PATH=$PWD/istio-1.11.5/bin:$PATH
```
Check istioctl version:
```
istioctl version
```
We don't have the Istio control plane installed and running yet. Let's go ahead and do that. There are three ways to install Istio:
- istioctl CLI tool
- Istio Operator
- Helm

We will use the istioctl approach to install Istio following some best practices to set you up for future success. In the second part of this lab (series 2) we'll explore how to use Helm.

Helm 3 is another common approach to installing and upgrading Istio. We'll see labs on Helm 3 in the second part of this workshop series.

## Installing Istio
Before we install Istio we will create a namespace where we will deploy Istio and create a Kubernetes service to represent the Istio control plane. These steps may be slightly different than what you see in other docs, but this is an important step to be able to use Istio's revision capabilities until the Istio "tags" functionality makes it into the project.

Start with creating the namespace:
```
kubectl create ns istio-system
```
Next let's create the control plane service istiod:
```
##### labs/02/istiod-service.yaml #####
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: istiod
    istio: pilot
    release: istio
  name: istiod
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  type: ClusterIP  
  ports:
  - name: grpc-xds
    port: 15010
  - name: https-dns
    port: 15012
  - name: https-webhook
    port: 443
    targetPort: 15017
  - name: http-monitoring
    port: 15014
  selector:
    app: istiod
```
```
kubectl apply -f labs/02/istiod-service.yaml
```
This is an additional step you may not see very clearly in the Istio docs; we need this step to workaround a long-standing issue with Istio revisions which we'll use in the next steps. Istio revisions allow us to run multiple versions of the Istio control plane.

Lastly, we will install the Istio control plane using the profile.

Our installation is "minimal" here as we will only be installing the istiod part of the control plane.
```
istioctl install -y -n istio-system -f labs/02/control-plane.yaml --revision 1-11-5
```
You should see output similar to this:
```
✔ Istio core installed
✔ Istiod installed
✔ Installation complete
```
We now have Istio installed! This istiod component includes various functionality like:

- xDS server for Envoy config
- Certificate Authority for signing workload certs
- Service discovery
- Sidecar injection webhook

If we check the istio-system workspace, we should see the control plane running:
```
kubectl get pod -n istio-system
```
```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istiod-1-11-5-78b88c997d-rpnck   1/1     Running   0          2m1s
```
From here, we can query the Istio control plane's debug endpoints to see what services we have running and what Istio has discovered.
```
kubectl exec -n istio-system deploy/istiod-1-11-5 -- pilot-discovery request GET /debug/registryz
```
The output of this command can be quite verbose as it lists all of the services in the Istio registry. Workloads are included in the Istio registry even if they are not officially part of the mesh (ie, have a sidecar deployed next to it). We leave it to the reader to grep for some of the previously deployed services (web-api, recommendation and purchase-history services). We will cover more of the debug endpoints in Lab 08

## Install sidecar for demo app
In this section we'll install a sidecar onto the httpbin service from the previous lab and explore it.

Run the following command to add the Istio sidecar to the httpbin service in the default namespasce:
```
##### labs/01/httpbin.yaml #####
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: httpbin
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  labels:
    app: httpbin
    service: httpbin
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8000
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: httpbin
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpbin
        version: v1
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: httpbin
      containers:
      - image: docker.io/kennethreitz/httpbin
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: httpbin
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```
k label namespace default istio.io/rev=1-11-5
k apply -f labs/01/httpbin.yaml
k rollout restart deployment httpbin
```
In the above command we configure istioctl to use the configmaps from our 1-11-5 revision. We can run multiple versions of Istio concurrently and can specify exactly which revision gets applied in the tooling.

## Recap
At this point we have installed the Istio control plane following a slightly different method than the official docs, but one that sets us up for success for operating Istio.

## Next lab
In the next lab we will leverage Istio's telemetry collection and scrape it into Prometheus, Grafana, and Kiali. Istio ships with some sample addons to install those components in a POC environment, but we'll look at a more realistic environment.
